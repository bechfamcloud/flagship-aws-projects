# Flagship Project 01 — Secure Incident & Intake Reporting Platform (Serverless)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a production-grade serverless AWS architecture designed
to solve a real-world business problem using secure, scalable, and cost-efficient services.

## Problem Statement

Organizations often lack a secure, auditable, and cost-effective way for users or employees
to submit sensitive incident reports or service requests in real time.

processes, and stores incident data while enabling notifications and auditability.
